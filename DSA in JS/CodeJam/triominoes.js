D - Project Euler #161: Triominoes 

This problem is a programming version of Problem 161 from projecteuler.net

A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges. There are two basic forms:



If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:



Any  by  grid for which  is divisible by  can be tiled with triominoes.

If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are  ways a  by  grid can be tiled with triominoes:



In how many ways can a  by  grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?
